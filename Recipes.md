Do you like cooking?
<br>
How many recipes do you remember?
<br>
I like cooking very much, but it's hard to remember that all recipes in my head.
<br>
So I bought some recipe books. But now my cute cat always plays with the book while I cook. She likes to sleep on books at night.
<br>
Sometimes, I find her trying to eat food in the book when she is hungry.
<br>
Only books, not phones or keyboards.
<br>
I decided to make an application in which you can find and read recipes during the cook.
<br>
I have been working in mobile development for 5 years.
<br>
In the past, it used to take ages to complete a screen by using Storyboard.
<br>
Now I use SwiftUI usually to design user interfaces.
<br>
See how SwiftUI helped me to make a recipe app. It took only a few hours.
<br>
I am going to install it on my mother's iPad, I can't wait to see how happy she would be.
