# Top 10% Certified Swift Skill

I am so thrilled to announce that I have passed the Swift assessment and got a certification on [TestDome](https://www.testdome.com/).
<br/>
Soon, I made [my Github profile](https://github.com/bytedriver) decorated with it.

I don't think that certifications matter. As long as you stay on fire with passion, you will get succeed eventually.
