Sir Francis Drake's ring (from Uncharted)

The main inscription on the ring is "Sic Parvis Magna". According to Nathan Drake, this was Francis Drake's motto, which means "Greatness From Small Beginnings."

Everyone might have an impressive beginning to their career.
For me, it wasn't a big one. However, it is never forgettable for me that my first open-source contribution had been merged, even though it was a tiny correction.
The small beginning made myself to be here now. So I am proud of it.
